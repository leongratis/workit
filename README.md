# workit
# brief info on the work: workit is a simple website for a telecommunication data servicing company
# NOTE: for the dev. only(I applied "before and after pseudo element" to add a solid curvy dark-blue & faint ash color background) 
# NOTE: for the Dev. only( I applied relative positioning and z-index, at the commented area -foot,footer,footy,- )
# NOTE: for the Dev. only (I used 'media queries' at certain breakpoint to make the website responsive for laptop,tablet and smart phones)
